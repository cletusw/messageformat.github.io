Thanks to:

## Implementations in other languages

[Jeff Hansen](https://github.com/jeffijoe) ([@jeffijoe](https://twitter.com/jeffijoe)) has written an [implementation for .NET](https://github.com/jeffijoe/messageformat.net) - it's a Portable Class Library, making it possible to use on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and pretty much any other .NET target.
