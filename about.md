## Credits

Thanks to:

* [Bazaarvoice](https://github.com/Bazaarvoice) - my employer - for letting me do cool stuff like this.
* Google has an implementation that is similar in Google Closure, I tried to vet my code against many of their tests.
* Norbert Lindenberg for showing me how good it can be.


## Implementations in other languages

[Jeff Hansen](https://github.com/jeffijoe) ([@jeffijoe](https://twitter.com/jeffijoe)) has written an [implementation for .NET](https://github.com/jeffijoe/messageformat.net) - it's a Portable Class Library, making it possible to use on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and pretty much any other .NET target.


## Additional tools

[icu-converter](https://github.com/alex-dow/icu-converter) is a NodeJS tool for converting message files in the [ICU Resource Bundle](http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale/resources) format into JSON or .property files.
